## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. We're building something useful together. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

---

## Getting the Dev Environment Running

See [Getting Started → Option 2: Local Development Setup](getting-started.md#option-2-local-development-setup) for the full walkthrough.

**Short version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/izah/izah-pos.git
cd izah-pos
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env     # fill in DATABASE_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed             # optional sample data
pnpm dev
```

---

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/split-tender-payment
   git checkout -b fix/decimal-serialization
   git checkout -b docs/update-deployment-guide
   ```
3. **Make your changes** — see Coding Standards below.
4. **Write or update tests** for any non-trivial logic.
5. **Verify everything passes:**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsc --noEmit   # TypeScript — 0 errors
   pnpm lint                # ESLint
   pnpm test                # Vitest unit tests
   pnpm build               # Full production build — 0 errors
   ```
6. **Commit** using the [commit message format](#commit-message-format).
7. **Open a Pull Request** targeting `main`.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** is enabled — no `any`, no implicit `undefined`.
- All props, function signatures, and API response types must be explicitly typed.
- Use `type` for shapes, `interface` for extensible objects.

### React / Next.js

- Use **Server Components** by default. Only add `"use client"` when you need browser APIs, event handlers, or state.
- Never call `noStore()` or `force-dynamic` inside a `"use client"` component — those only work in Server Components.
- Keep Server Components **pure** — no side effects, no mutations.
- Use `unstable_noStore as noStore` from `next/cache` on every page/layout that fetches data to prevent stale RSC payloads.

### Prisma / Database

- All `Decimal` fields from Prisma must be `.toNumber()` before being passed as props to Client Components (they are not plain JSON-serializable).
- Migrations must be created via `pnpm db:migrate` — never edit migration files manually.
- New features requiring schema changes should include a migration file in the PR.

### Forms

- All forms use `react-hook-form` with a `zodResolver`. Define your Zod schema first.
- Server-side validation must always mirror client-side validation — never trust the client alone.

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only — no custom CSS unless it's a CSS variable or animation keyframe.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging.
- All colours must use the existing CSS variable tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-primary`, etc.) — never hardcode hex values in components.

### File naming

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `use-kebab-case.ts`
- Utilities / lib: `kebab-case.ts`
- API routes: `route.ts` inside descriptive folders

---

## Testing

### Unit tests (Vitest)

```bash
pnpm test            # run once
pnpm test:ui         # open Vitest UI
```

Unit tests live in `src/tests/`. Test pure functions and utilities.

### End-to-end tests (Playwright)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e        # headless
pnpm test:e2e:ui     # with browser UI
```

E2E tests cover critical paths: login → checkout → receipt.

### Before submitting a PR

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

All four must pass with zero errors.

## Commit Message Format

We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `docs` — documentation only
- `style` — formatting, whitespace (no logic change)
- `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` — adding or updating tests
- `chore` — build process, deps, tooling

**Examples:**
```
feat(pos): add split tender payment support
fix(sales): serialize Decimal fields before passing to client
docs(deployment): add Caddy reverse proxy example
refactor(auth): remove DB call from proxy.ts
```

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template (description, screenshots for UI changes).
2. Link any related GitHub issues with `Closes #123`.
3. Ensure CI passes (TypeScript + lint + tests + build).
4. A maintainer will review within a few business days.
5. Address review comments and push updates to the same branch.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/izah/izah-pos/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) with:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Browser/OS, Node.js version
- Relevant error messages or screenshots

---

## Suggesting Features

Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/izah/izah-pos/discussions) or a [Feature Request Issue](https://github.com/izah/izah-pos/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

Check the [Project Roadmap Context](#project-roadmap-context) below before suggesting features that are explicitly saved for later.

## Project Roadmap Context

The following features are **deliberately excluded from v0.1 MVP** but are planned. Please don't open PRs for these without discussing first — they require architectural changes:

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Multi-store / multi-location | Planned — requires `Store` model + tenant scoping |
| Product variants / matrix | Planned — requires `variants` jsonb → dedicated table |
| Loyalty points & tiers | Planned — requires `Customer` model + rule engine |
| Kitchen Display System | Planned — separate app + WebSocket |
| Multiple tax rules | Planned — replace single `taxRate` with `TaxRule[]` |
| Plugin marketplace | Planned — folder-based plugins → dynamic registry |
| AI forecasting | Planned — premium plugin |
| Hosted SaaS (izah.app) | Planned — same codebase, env-based gating |

For the full roadmap, see [izah.com/roadmap](https://izah.com/roadmap).
