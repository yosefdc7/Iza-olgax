# API Reference

Internal REST API endpoints used by the Izah POS application. These are not a public external API — they are called by the app's own frontend.

> All endpoints return `application/json`. Unless noted, the request body must be `Content-Type: application/json`.
> All endpoints except `/api/auth/*`, `/api/settings` (GET), and `/api/setup/*` require an authenticated session (cookie set by Better Auth).

## Authentication (Better Auth)

Authentication is handled by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/). The catch-all handler lives at `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`.

### Sign In

```
POST /api/auth/sign-in/email
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "...",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "role": "ADMIN"
  }
}
```

On success, a `better-auth.session_token` cookie is set automatically. The app uses `window.location.href = "/pos"` to force a hard redirect so the cookie is captured on the very next request.

**Error Response (400 / 401):**
```json
{
  "error": { "message": "Invalid email or password", "status": 401 }
}
```

---

### Sign Out

```
POST /api/auth/sign-out
```

Clears the session cookie. No body required.

### Get Session

  },

## Products

### GET /api/ping

Returns database connectivity status. Used by the setup wizard and monitoring tools.

## Setup Wizard API

These endpoints are only accessible during the initial setup flow (before `setupComplete = true` in the database). They are blocked or redirected after setup is complete.

---

### GET /api/setup/status

Probes the database connection and returns the current setup state. Called by the setup wizard on load to determine which steps to show.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "envOk": true,
  "dbConnected": true,
  "dbInitialized": true,
  "hasAdmin": false,
  "setupComplete": false,
  "missingEnv": [],
  "dbError": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `envOk` | boolean | `true` if `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` are set |
| `dbConnected` | boolean | `true` if a TCP connection to Postgres was established |
| `dbInitialized` | boolean | `true` if Prisma migrations have been applied |
| `hasAdmin` | boolean | `true` if at least one user with `role = ADMIN` exists |
| `setupComplete` | boolean | `true` if `BusinessSettings.setupComplete = true` in the DB |
| `missingEnv` | string[] | List of missing required environment variable names |
| `dbError` | string \| null | Human-readable database error message if connection failed |

If `setupComplete` is `true`, this endpoint also sets the `izah-setup-complete` cookie to heal any client state where the cookie was missing.

---

Runs `prisma migrate deploy` programmatically to initialize / apply database migrations.

**Body:** empty `{}`

**Error Responses:**

```

---

### POST /api/setup/complete
